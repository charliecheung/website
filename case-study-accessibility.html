  <h3>project overview</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    In 2014, the Government of British Columbia announced its Accessibility 2024 plan to make B.C. the most progressive province in Canada for people with disabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the 22% of Canadians over the age of 15 who live with at least one disability, the journey to use the web effectively has been one with many barriers – this act along with the many proposed around Canada will aim to make Canada an inclusive and barrier-free country.
  </p>
  <p>
    My task was to create a Modern SharePoint experience following the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA using out of the box SharePoint functionality. The ask from the client was to create site pages for the organization that form a cohesive brand and create an engaging environment.
  </p>
  <img src="images/accessibility/First.png" alt="site landing page">
  <br />
  <br />
  <h5>challenge</h5>
  <h3>a pre-emptive strike towards success in two months</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Our goal for this project was to go beyond the acceptance criteria of meeting the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 by June 2024 as required in the B.C. Accessibility Act and conform to the acceptance criteria of the 2.1 Level AA standards.
  </p>
  <p>
    If broken down into points, our goal was quite simple: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make SharePoint pass the acceptance criteria for WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards</li>
    <li>Do it with as much out-of-the-box functionality as possible</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    As our project developed, we came up with some others:
    <ul>
      <li>Give branding recommendations that keep accessibility in mind</li>
      <li>Give a mega menu redesign recommendation</li>
      <li>Create something simple that can be used by technology beginners</li>
      <li>Make it responsive</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3>users and audience</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    As a UX designer, I led the design of the SharePoint pages between June and July 2019, collaborating with our business analysts, SharePoint developers, tech lead, and project manager. My role included leading and delivering the following deliverables:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Conduct two workshops with the client and educate stakeholders on UX best practices</li>
    <li>Deliver high fidelity mock-ups for the home, teams, and staff pages to the client</li>
    <li>Supplement a deliverable that documents accessibility and brand strategy for the organization</li>
    <li>Provide UX recommendations in redesigning a mega menu</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3>scope and constraints</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    At the start of our project we had to familiarize ourselves with the organization: their current site, organizational structure, governance, etc. This involved getting access to the client's system, doing a heuristic evaluation of their site, and defining clear success criteria that can be met in two months. We also had to understand the technological comfort level of our users to determine future training requirements and change management strategy.

  <h3>the discovery</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    I was impressed by the level of technological understanding and articulation of our client – it seemed like they had a solution in mind but needed our consultation on important design decisions. As this site acts as the single source of truth for the organization, it is an integral part of every division’s workflow. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p style="text-align:center">
    <em>“We need a mapping of current building blocks to modern experience and we’re looking for your expertise and UX recommendations.”</em>
  </p>
  <br />
  <p>
    The client was also very honest about their addition of features on a whim which caused even power users to feel lost and frustrated. As we were left with the troubling discovery of being unable to identify the key design decisions that led to specific functionality, we were able to build an empathy with the client that made us recognize the lack of support we were offering to immature users or those with disabilities. The empathy that we built through our initial workshop was the beginning in creating an accessibility site.
  </p>
  </br>
  <h3>reframing the problem</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    For creating solutions, I used a ‘how might we…’ statement to reframe the problem we are trying to solve. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <p style="text-align: center">
    <em>“How might we create an inclusive and engaging environment suitable for users with disabilities and power users.”</em>
  </p>
  </br>
  <h3>deeper insights</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    Before I could jump into designing the actual pages, it was important that we defined success for this project. To do so, I made a note of high value requirements that needed to be considered in order to make this project a success.

  <h3>how we got there</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    To design for the client, I came up with three questions that needed to be answered:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>How do we design for everyone?</li>
    <li>What tasks should be considered?</li>
    <li>How can we improve navigation?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The existing site was poorly engaging the users through an outdated design and a heavy navigation that often led to frustrations. Building upon the empathy and trust we've established; we took what was obvious to us and examined each of those assumptions to determine what might be difficult for users with disabilities. 
  </p>
  <p>
    To do this, I framed out each of the assumptions we typically make when designing a site and compared it with ways a person with disabilities might interpret it as.
  </p>
  <img src="images/accessibility/Frame.png" alt="assumptions">
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    Then I took the assumptions and risk areas and listed out all of the WCAG 2.1 Level A and Level AA acceptance criteria that would be applicable. 
  </p>
  <br />
  <img src="images/accessibility/Frame2.png" alt="mari bakeshop case study user flow">
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <img src="images/accessibility/Frame3.png" alt="mari bakeshop case study user flow">
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    Taking in these considerations, I created my own SharePoint sites for these three pages and configured a component that would meet each of the client's requirements for what they wanted on the page. For each, I tested out how they stood up to the guidelines provided by WCAG 2.1 and only chose the components that would pass every acceptance criteria relevant to it.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3>navigation - mega menu</h3>
  <hr/>
  <br />
  <p>
    As the central hub for information in the organization, the site held an incredibly large amount of links that saw use depending on who the user was. Through discussion, we were met with resistance on reorganizing the information architecture to something more simple as each stakeholder prioritized a subset of links. To put a visual to the difficulties a user might have navigating the site, especially on mobile, I mocked up the current state of the menu as a mobile menu.
  </p>
  <br />
  <img style="max-width: 400px;" src="images/accessibility/mm.gif" alt="mega menu animation">
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    After seeing the sheer amount of links they had, the organization asked us for recommendations on how to solve this problem. Knowing that they requested to keep their IA, I took to exploring and researching other organizations and how they implemented a mega menu. Some of these organizations that I took inspiration from where: Adidas, Home Depot, and Lululemon. 

    By testing out what these organizations did, I mocked up examples of what the mega menu could possibly look like and how to reduce the amount of scrolling a user would have to search through on mobile. However, there was no out-of-the-box SharePoint mega menu that we could use and explained that this would take customization.
  </p>
  <br />
  <img src="images/accessibility/frame4.png" alt="mega menu redesign options" >
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3>demo to client</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    After the creation of these mock-ups, we had a second workshop with the client to present what we had discovered and created. 
  </p>
  <img src="images/accessibility/demo.png" alt="mari bakeshop case study user flow">
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    With visuals present, we were able to engage in discussions that brought up pain points we had not identified earlier on. Wrapping up the workshop phase of our project, the final step would be a write up of our formal recommendations and discoveries. In addition, we needed to address the concerns of our client which included:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Concerns over meeting WCAG 2.1 requirements for mobile and mega menu</li>
    <li>How can the mega menu be made more efficient</li>

  <h3>final deliverable</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    For the final deliverable, I focused heavily on the client's desire to continue building their SharePoint site with UX best practices and included additonal information related to how they should do a heuristics evaluation, the steps I took to determining a colour scheme for their brand, and UX exercises that might be useful. Since the client asked for as much out-of-the-box functionality as possible, I broke down each page into what SharePoint components were used and added how I configured each of them so that it could be replicated.

  <h3>outcomes and lessons</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    This two month project felt like a whirlwind at times but at the end of it all, we delivered a detailed recommendation and strategy to improve the UX of their site. The final deliverable was met with positive feedback from our client with little to no additional feedback or questions on our recommendations. Since it was also built with primarily out-of-the-box functionality, the effort required by the developers will be reduced when it comes to styling customizations. Because we were able to hit our mark, our client will serve as a web accessibility leader in British Columbia by leading by example.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the months after the end of my involvement on the project, we have since created a UAT environment for our client to migrate their content over to a modern SharePoint experience and build out the site as designed.
