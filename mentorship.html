  <p>Hi, I'm Charlie and I am a user experience design consultant in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.</p>
  
    <p>My goal is and always will be to present ux in an accessible way. Having transitioned into this career myself, I know of the doubts and worries that can keep you from this amazing career. Believe me, it took me eight long years getting to where I am today!
    </p>
    <p>
    Whether you want to dip your toe into UX design or you are ready to jump right in, I want to support your ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you have the resources, let's book a chat and talk about your career, who you want to be, and how we can get you there.
    </p>
    <p>
    I can help you navigate your ux career journey and review your work so we can make sure you're putting your best foot forward.
    </p>

    <em>“Charlie was able to clarify a LOT of things about my career path. I’ve been overthinking about my goals for more than two weeks now and my chat with Charlie gave me confidence to pursue the one that has been really calling out to me for months now. It’s only been a single session but I love how she was able to pinpoint my strengths (which I’ve never even thought of before) and used it as a basis for the kind of creative career that best suits my previous experiences and current interests. Thank you so much Charli and looking forward to our next session!!" - Bea</em>

    <em>"Charlie was excellent and very thorough at explaining the proper steps to pursuing a UX career . Not only did she answer my questions, but she took the time to ask about my background to see how can I apply that knowledge into design and development. Charlie broke down the 5 main areas of UX and what the responsibilities are. She gave me great resources to use in order to become stronger at design and gain knowledge about how to approach case studies.

    Along with the advice she gave me, Charlie was super encouraging and positive. She helped me to not be so nervous about persuading a career in UX. She even gave tips about how to build more confidence when presented ideas or things that I have worked on. Talking to her was one of the best decisions I have made, and I would recommend anyone who is think about pursuing UX to talk to her. " - Joi</em>

    <em>"Charlie is an awesome mentor, she's really down-to-earth and critical when appropriate!
    She really took the time to address each concern I had in regards to my portfolio review and highlight important concepts to prioritize in the projects work on. 
    She always allowed me to speak my opinions and is very straight-forward about her insightful perspectives on ux as a whole. Coming out of the session, I felt motivated and determined to continue my work with all the knowledge she provided me. Strongly recommend anyone who is starting out in ux/ui who is in search of guidance to schedule a session with Charlie!  - Aaron</em>
