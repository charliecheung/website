  <h4>The Problem</h4>
  <h3>Legal professionals were spending too much time drafting contracts</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    DraftAI is an AI-powered legal tech platform that drafts and analyzes legal terms in contracts. Our original “surface-area-less” implementation was met with user frustrations as it disrupted document formatting. And the inability to save or return to previous inputs caused additional work for our users. This lack of flexibility compounded their frustrations, as users had no means to edit, refine questions, or set parameters for their desired outcome.

  <h4>The Solution</h4>
  <h3>Offering precise control and customizing inputs giving immediate context and flexibility</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    By offering precise control, customizable options, and a seamless integration into existing workflows, we empowered our users to craft with meticulous precision, ensuring their documents are flawlessly tailored to their exacting standards and personal preferences. We went through several iterations, arriving at a solution that sped up the drafting process, allowing our legal professionals to support more clients and draft faster.

  <h4>Role</h4>
  <hr />
  <p>
    As the UX Design Lead, I undertook the responsibility of managing and leading the entire UX design process and collaborated with a team of four developers, a project manager, and the founders from January to May 2023.

  <h4>User Research</h4>

  <br />
  <img src="images/aidrafting/Research & Insights.png" alt="design system case study title">
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    At the conclusion of our initial research phase, we knew that legal professionals needed to draft agreements while adhering to certain constraints. For example, preferences of the court, judiciary requirements, client requirements, etc. Though most legal professionals were confident given their experience, they were looking for language to help them get started. Our current implementation drafted directly into the legal agreement, often breaking the meticulously crafted formatting our users spent time doing and only provided one option each time. Our users felt the need to open a separate document to save these responses so that they could review and choose the best one, which caused frustration.
  </p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>Our question became,</p>
  <i style="font-size: 32px">
    How might we design our tool to serve as an assistant, respecting users' autonomy and decision-making while seamlessly integrating into their workflow without disruptions?

    <h4>KPIs</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      We used Google's HEART Framework to track our KPIs. This approach provided us with valuable insights and actionable data to drive iterative improvements and ensured our solution aligned with user needs and goals.

    <h4>Design Iterations</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      After emphathizing with our legal professionals, we had a lot of ideas on how we can improve our drafting experience. We had set up a Council (users in our target audience) to perform usability tests with and went through 4 iterations of feedback and validation. Our solution allowed users to get multiple options with each drafting action and save language in a separate modal so they could refine it comfortably without breaking their agreement's formatting.

    <h4>Results</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      The final solution was a complete redesign and expansion of the drafting feature. The new Draft tab allowed users the ability to provide a detailed prompt through textual and interactive components to set expectations prior to the generated language being drafted. In addition to prompt generation support, users would receive three options with a single action where they could save and refine prior to inserting the generated language into the agreements.
      <ul>
        <li>144% increase in monthly active users (MAU)</li>
        <li>16.72% increase in average session length</li>
        <li>138.46% increase in average number of actions per session</li>
        <li>63% of daily active users (DAU) copied and inserted the generated language into their agreements.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Final Solution</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Our final solution allowed users to generate multiple options with a single prompt. Users could also freely adjust the parameters of their prompt, save generated text, and edit without modifying the formatting of their agreement.

    <h4>Reflection</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>
      As we continue to improve DraftAI, I carry the principal that it's not enough to make software feel like magic. In addition to that, we need to have users feel like they are the magicians. I'm extremely proud of the work we did on this project and the direction this product is heading. Reflecting, I'd like to consider cross platform compatability in the future as our users expressed working off of a tablet when required to travel in the future. Overall, I'm satisfied and proud of where DraftAI is today and excited for the futurezz.
