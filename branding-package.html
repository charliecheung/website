  <h3>your values. your vision. your voice.</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I'm just here to turn those into visuals.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having worked in a start up then eventually, a company that supported enterprises I have seen my fair share of failed project ands products. Being a UX designer, I am naturally inclined to finding patterns: in people, design, and in thinking. What I noticed from those failed projects is that all of them had a visually appealing brand but it lacked the substance and story to move it forward.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can see it in amateur storytelling all the time. There is nothing interesting, nothing exciting, nothing innovative that will actually get people talking. It's a cookie cutter template.
  </p>
  <p>
    And while that might be adequate, there is a substantial difference between those that are alright with just passing and those that want to succeed.
  </p>
  <p>
    So my question to you is: <strong>Who do you want to be?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    For my branding package, the goal is to create a complete narrative that puts your brand, your clients, and your story in the center. My goal is to keep you involved in the process to make sure that whatever direction we take, is the story you want to tell.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will do this together by creating an atomic design package. An atomic design process, based on Brad Frost's atomic design process, creates a strong foundation made of design atoms (like fonts, colours, and textures) then build upon those atoms to create molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This ensures that we create a cohesive brand that is instantly recognizable and memorable. By building from atoms, we also eliminate a lot of design time whenever we need to create something new because our atoms are so small and focused!
  </p>
  <p>
    Check out this example template of how atomic branding design works to see just how simple and effective it is!

  <h3>atoms</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    The atoms are our most abstract elements, so things like colour palette, typography, iconography, and the voice or visual language we want our brand to have. While these might not be the most outstanding things on their own, they are our essential building blocks that we will discuss in our kick off consultation.

  <br />
  <h3>molecules</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    This is where things start to take shape. Our molecules are a combination of our atoms and act as small functional units to our brand. The assets we will develop here are our logos and moodboards. At this stage, we will come up with 5-7 logos and two moodboards that will further decide the direction our brand should have. Logos have a two change request limit (additional changes will be provided at an extra cost).

  <br />
  <h3>organisms</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Molecules are examined and form organisms: relatively complex, building blocks to your brand. The assets we will develop at this stage are our letterhead and email signature. At this stage, our design becomes more concrete and our brand story starts to become more fleshed out. The organisms we will create are probably going to be one of the first things your client sees of you and should define the brand in it's simplicity.
  </p>
  <img src="images/branding/Organisms.png" alt="atomic branding design organisms"/>
  <br />
  <h3>templates</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    At this stage in our brand design process, we slowly start to rid ourselves of our chemistry language and begin with something closely related to our final output. At this stage, our powerpoint layout and style guide will come to life. Here, our design takes what abstract entities we created as atoms and molecules and turns it into something client ready and client focused.

  <br />
  <h3>pages</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Pages are what our atomic brand design process has been leading up to. It is here that we create a high fidelity vision of our website and business cards for your future clients. Your brand has presence, has a story, has your values embedded into each minute detail. Congratulations! And thank you for letting me be a part of your success story!
