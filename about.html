<p class="about-body">
  My name is Charli and I am a Hong Kong born, Canada based user experience designer.<br />
  <br />
I started my UX career as many do, by transitioning from another field. With a background in <b>Computer Science</b>, I spent a few years as a <b>software developer</b> working at a AR/VR start up before realizing UX was where I wanted to make the biggest impact.<br />
<br />
I transitioned into a role as a <b>UX Consultant</b>, building products with an outstanding service experience for clients and users. Then I moved into a senior design position working in the healthcare tech industry where I learned how to solve problems creatively while working within the constraints of a rigid process full of concrete regulations.<br />
<br />
In my current role as a <b>Lead Product Designer</b>, I am creating a design system, working closely with stakeholders to strategize our product roadmap, and building the foundations of a design team.<br />
<br />
A couple years ago, I decided to start a <b>YouTube channel</b> talking about design. What started as a way to talk about something that none of my friends had an interest in, became a platform for me to share my life and career with an amazing community of passionate designers.<br />
<br />
Having spent most of my life practicing martial arts, I like to spend my free time as a taekwondo and tai chi instructor. I’m also an avid journaler and a pet parent to my dog, Bun. My latest passion has been in homemaking and reading.<br />
