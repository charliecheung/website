  <h3>case study: collaborative canvas</h3>
  <hr/>
  <img src="images/collaborative canvas/title.png" alt="collaborative canvas design">
</br>
  <h3>project overview</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Collaborative Canvas is an online tool meant for teachers, creatives, and remote teams. The goal of this application is to allow for real time collaboration and solve the barriers created by distance and the pain points related to remote collaboration.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>my role</h3>

  <h3>problem</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Poor team collaboration is a barrier to an organization’s success.
  </p>
  <p>
    For creatives and teachers, feedback and review is crucial to designing, building empathy, and gaining perspective. However, feedback is often in human subtleties - the way a person’s eyes flickered, breathing, and facial expressions. 
  </p>
    <p>
    Similarily, pictures are worth a thousand words. In education and the creative process, a collaborative effort is often lost in translation. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Without the consideration of the human side of collaboration, it is impossible to facilitate effective workshops and provide guidance.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>approach / strategy</h3>
  <hr/>
  <br />
  <p>
    I knew this tool had the potential to help teachers and tutors especially when teaching math. The first thing I did was interview math teachers and ux designers to give me some insights on what their pain points where when teaching and running remote design workshops. 
  </p>
  <img src="images/collaborative canvas/user interview1.png" alt="user interview one" />
  <img src="images/collaborative canvas/user interview2.png" alt="user interview two" />
  <p>I highlighted their most valuable feedback in the quotes below.</p>
  <img src="images/collaborative canvas/quotes.png" alt="user interview quotes" />
  <p>
    After doing these qualitative interviews, I quickly realized that this app must mimic human reaction as much as possible and allow for indications to the teacher or facilitator whether or not a thought was being left unsaid. I categorized my findings into three main themes that this app must address in order to be a successful, useful product. 
  </p>
  <img src="images/collaborative canvas/theme buckets.png" alt="theme buckets" />
  <p>
    Next, I recognized that this app will be used differently depending on the user so I created user profiles based on the tasks and goals I was able to identify.

  <br />
  <h3>conceptualization</h3>
  <hr/>
<p>
    For the Conceptualization phase, I started by creating the information architecture I expected the application to have then created low fidelity concepts for the primary use cases. I tested the application with teachers and designers to see if we were on the right path. Once I was confident in the design, I was able to begin creating the high fidelity designs.

  <h3>solution</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    Collaborative Canvas makes it easy to connect and collaborate with others - providing eloquent, simple, and human feedback remotely.
  </p>
  <p>
    Efficiently and personally, communicate ideas and thoughts between individuals or groups.

<div class="clearfix floater">
  <img style="max-width: 250px;" src="images/collaborative canvas/home.png" alt="collaborative canvas home screen">
  <div class="project" style="max-width: 500px">
    <p style="padding: 20px;">
      Collaborative Canvas opens up a home screen that allows users to set their status, make a call, start a chat, and search through a list on contacts.
    </p>
    <br />
    </div>
</div>

<div class="clearfix floater">
  <img style="max-width: 400px;" src="images/collaborative canvas/call_faciliatator.png" alt="collaborative canvas facilitator call">
  <div class="project" style="max-width: 500px">
    <p style="padding: 20px;">
      As the facilitator, users are able to see all participants on the canvas and are given tools such as: record, share, chat, add a user, import, and end call. For documentation, the record tool lets users keep a copy of the chat messages, audio, and whatever was drawn on the canvas during the call. For the 'share' option, users can choose to export the canvas or send a link. Other features include being able to set the colour the user writes in, the stroke thickness, and an eraser tool.
    </p>
    <br />

<div class="clearfix floater">
  <img style="max-width: 400px;" src="images/collaborative canvas/call_notify.png" alt="collaborative canvas call notify">
  <div class="project" style="max-width: 500px">
    <p style="padding: 20px;">
      Facilitators are able to see if a user has a comment or question through the notification on a user's icon. This is hidden from the other users in the canvas and only available for the facilitator. This feature is best for introverted users that have a comment.
    </p>
    <br />

<div class="clearfix floater">

  <div class="project" style="max-width: 500px">
    <p style="padding: 20px;">
      From the user's side, this is their window into the canvas. With the same functionality as the facilitator, the only differences include the coloured icon near the bottom of the screen. If the user would like to have a chance to speak or ask a question, they can click the icon to let the facilitator know rather than risk interrupting the current speaker. These notifiers will not be visible to other users.

  <div class="project" style="max-width: 500px">
    <p style="padding: 20px;">
      A chat window is also available for any written comments the users want to share. If selected, the chat window will open while it is hidden by default.

  <h3>project learning</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    This application is still in it's initial conceptualization phase and has a lot of potential once a cohesive branding is created. As an MVP, I imagine the next phase for Collaborative Canvas would involve more user testing and fleshing out some of the polished functionality notable in communication applications such as Skype or Microsoft Teams. The highlight of Collaborative Canvas is the priority that drawing and annotations have. I think this application has a huge potential for entertainment streaming services such as Twitch, where it would be a great app for artists to collaborate together. Additional features I would like to see would be inspired from drawing applications such as Paint Tool Sai and Procreate - where users are able to play and customize brushes and draw on individual layers.
