  <h3>project overview</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Real Deal Estate is a global commercial real estate services firm. The company's headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois and it is among the world's largest commercial real estate services firms, with revenues of US$8.8 billion in 2019.
 <br />
 <br />
 The Deal Lifecycle app began as an application meant to streamline the deal process for sales agents at Cushman & Wakefield Edmonton. The goal of this application is to promote transparency between sales agents and marketing managers. How does a marketing team know when the brochure needs to be made? Why are sales agents expected to enter the same information twice? How can the teams work seamlessly and better manage their data? We were asked to address these questions and to find a solution.
  </p>
  <img style="max-width: 750px;" src="images/real deal estate/overview.png" alt="illustration of man with headset">
  <br />
  <h3>context on the deal lifecycle</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    For the rest of this case study, the Deal Lifecycle revolves around the process of a sale of a property. In the most typical case, sales agents find clients with properties they are wanting to sell or lease to others. The sales agent gets the details of the property - these are things like the square footage, location, building type, etc. and negotiates with the client to come to an agreement about the contract and price point. Once the agreement is signed, the sales agent must update Cushman & Wakefield so that the marketing team can add it to their system and create a brochure for advertisement. This brochure includes photos and details of the property that are added to the company website and social media platforms. Once created, the brochure needs to be approved by the sales agent, the marketing head, and another agent. When the brochure is finished, the marketing team tells the sales agent and they are in charge of touring the property for the agreed upon time of the agreement. If the property is leased or sold at a price that has been accepted by the client and the buyer, the sales agent is able to make their commission.
  </p>

  <br />
  <h3>the challenge</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    The ask of the client could be grouped into three distinct themes:
    <li>Streamline the communication channel between sales agents and marketing</li>
    <li>Create a place for sales agents to enter in their details</li>
    <li>Let sales agents work anywhere</li>
    <br />
  </p>
  <img style="max-width: 750px;" src="images/real deal estate/theme 1.png" alt="deal lifecycle"> 
  <p>
    The first theme deals with the numerous amounts of emails that go back and forth between sales agents. It was expressed by marketing that it was difficult to get a hold of sales agents because of their on the go style of work and sales agents expressed that they were never made aware of what marketing is doing and where they are in the brochure design process. As well, there are times in the deal lifecycle process where assets need to be sent and approved. Each deal is managed by multiple agents, with a single lead and up to four supporting agents. In order to get assets approved, the lead agent must be the one to do the approval. Making sure that priority items get pushed to the right people so there was no loss was something that was really important to our client.
    <br />
  </p>
  <img style="max-width: 750px;" src="images/real deal estate/theme 2.png" alt="deal lifecycle"> 
  <p>
    The second theme was a key motive in the client’s desire for a solution. Sales agents work on 100% commission and rely on the relationships they build with their clients. The problem our client found was that when a sales agent left the firm, they took their clients with them. They wanted a way to keep details on their clients to make sure they maintain a relationship with the right people. Also, one agent can manage many different properties and making sure the deal docuemnts are going to the right agent has proven difficult when speaking with our stakeholders.
    <br />
  </p>
  <img style="max-width: 750px;" src="images/real deal estate/theme 3.png" alt="deal lifecycle"> 
  <p>
    Finally, our third theme deals with the fast paced, and on the go work style of sales agents. Through user interviews, we found that sales agents work at home, in the car, on transit to, and from showings. Basically everywhere. They also spent very little time in the actual office. To make their work accessible, our solution needed to enable sales agents to work anywhere. This would be one of the most influential themes of the solution because sales agents used a variety of tools and applications to do their work.

  <h3>my role</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    This project began in early 2019 but I had joined in 2020. Our originally team had gone through many changes where two key members had left the company. We were left in a state where previous recommendations of an off the shelf solution did not suit the actually needs of the project. Now, then how have we spent almost a year and realized that we were going down the wrong direction how do we make things work?
  </p>
  <P>
    I took the mantle in leading the design of the solution between January 2020 and April 2020. I collaborated with a ux researcher, two project managers, a software architect, and two developers.
  </P>
  <P>
    As this was a high priority project and a vip client, we had eyes on us and check ins with leadership that included our CTO and Business Development Director who had completed the sale and was the main point of contact with the client.
  </p>
  <p>   
    I completed my work on the project at the end of April 2020 after we released the first phase of our solution.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>plan</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    As a late addition to the project team and with a client presentation in three weeks, I needed to get ramped up quickly. Since our head office and the client are based in Edmonton, I took the Red Arrow up from Calgary on literally the coldest days ever to do a two day workshop with the software architect and researcher to figure out what our plan was for our end of discovery client presentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    In that two day workshop, we brainstormed over whether the off the shelf solution would work, how can we present our solution to the client, and mapped out the entire deal lifecycle to determine what our solution and presentation should look like. The three of us worked collaboratively and were occasionally joined by our Business Director and CTO. 
  </p>
  <img style="max-width: 750px; padding-bottom: 40px;" src="images/real deal estate/cwe9.png" alt="deal lifecycle"> <br />
    <p>
      We started the workshop off by going through our out of the box solution. This application was presented to us by a previous member of the team and believed to be an all encompassing solution. We debated on the use of the application and decided to test out one of identified user stories and see if we could complete the task using it. 
    </p>
    <img style="max-width: 750px; padding-bottom: 40px;" src="images/real deal estate/edmonton workshop 1.png" alt="deal lifecycle">  <br />
    <p>
      We chose, “a user should be able to enter in property details to the application.” The idea of it sounds simple enough but the thing about a property is that it could be many different types. The property could be land, a housing unit, or a unit inside a building. A property could also have multiple units and we found that the application did not have the customization capabilities necessary for our client.
  </p>
  <p>so, now what?</p>
  <br />
  <p>The original team had spent months doing interviews and other research to try to learn about the client’s workflow, how were we going to tell them that our solution wasn’t going to work for them and that we needed to pivot to a custom solution.</p>
  <p>Throughout the project, the client has trusted our team and the work that DevFacto has given them and we thought it would be a huge disservice to try to spin the out of the box solution as anything else but what it really was - which was a failure.
  </p>
  <img style="max-width: 750px; padding-bottom: 40px;" src="images/real deal estate/cwe3.png" alt="deal lifecycle"> 
  <br />
  <p>After we solidified our understanding that a custom solution was the way to go, we went back to the journey map. This was created through a series of workshops and interviews to understand the deal lifecycle. In it explains the entire process for the sales agent, what tools they use in each phase, and what are the necessary actions.
  </p>
  <img style="max-width: 750px; padding-bottom: 40px;" src="images/real deal estate/edmonton workshop 2.png" alt="deal lifecycle">  
  <br />
  <p>As we moved into our second day of the workshop, the next thing we did was lay out a solid strategy for the development of the deal lifecycle app. We whiteboarded out a plan of the features we thought of and created sketches on our idea that we presented to each other. By the end of the second day, I returned back to Calgary with an understanding of the task at hand and went to create the presentation with the team.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>reframing the solution</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    We found that our solution to Real Deal Estate needed to be broken down into three phases. These will be illustrated below.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>phase i - migrating data from reapps</h3>
  <br />
  <p>We needed to first off, get all of the data stored in ReApps into our new application and it is from our new application that we should be able to pull data on listings and employees so they can be added to the external website.</p>
  <p>Our phase one plan also included setting up the building blocks of the application. Without a solid foundation, there is no way we could build a proper design solution. Our first phase involved assimilating all of the data into one app so sales agents can input their information and setting up our solution’s architecture to support the features and goals of Phase II and Phase III.</p>
  <br />
  <h3>phase ii - getting the agents to use the app</h3>
  <hr/>
    <p>
      Without the agents on board, the product would not be a success. There’s a Chinese idiom that says, “the path that a stream of water takes deepens throughout generations.” It basically means that we repeat the patterns of previous generations. When junior sales agents start at the firm, they learn what they do from the sales agent that advises them. That way of teaching has led to having no standardization when it comes to the listings detailing process and a variety of applications used. 
    </p>  
    <p>
      We needed to create an app that incentivized sales agents to use. Instead of forcing them to move all of their listing and clients details in one phase, we broke it down into two. In Phase II, we planned for a soft roll over of details from sales agents by moving the brochure process from email to the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the current workflow, sales agents and the marketing team would go back and forth on emails when deciding over the brochure design and requesting approvals. This process will be moved to the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another pain point identified by sales agents was the number of times data needed to be entered into their systems. Sales agents would need to enter details on the listings and the client once when the deal was signed but because of the way brochures were handled, they needed to enter them again to start that work process. The app would provide a feature to automate data entry for listings and provide integration with applications that we believe will not be able to be retired in Phase II like CoStar.
    </p>
  <h3>phase iii - a feature to excite agents</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    In Phase I, we architected out a foundation for our new solution. In Phase II, we delivered a solution that integrates other applications and completed the tasks that our client asked for.
But we wanted to wow our client.
  </p>
  <p>
    Phase III revolved around creating a feature that would give value to sales agents adding in their contacts. We dedicated Phase III to a mobile app to work in tandem with our custom solution. Sales agents would be able to add in contact details and items in their wishlist. This is the beginning of the insights system where wishlist items would match a client to a property to aid the sales agent in managing their network.
  </p>
  <p>
    On February 28th, 2020, we presented the solution and our findings to the client. The deck was built in Figma and the slides are shown below.
  </p>
  <img style="max-width: 750px" src="images/real deal estate/Deck.png" alt="client presentation slides">
  <p style="padding-top:50px">
    With the stakeholders on board, we moved into Phase One of the project.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h3>solution</h3>
  <hr/>
  <p>
    As this will become a long engagement with the client, we wanted to create a Design System for our custom solution. This was to ensure a consistent standard to our design that will provide an agile team the flexibility to implement new features or support onboarding new developers or designers to the project.
  </p>
  <p>
    We followed the <a href="https://designsystemchecklist.com/">Design System checklist</a> and created it in Figma, separating contents into pages. Screencaps of our work are shown below. 
  </p>
  </br>
  <h3>Design Language</h3>
  <p>
    Like any language, a design language is a methodical way of communicating with your audience through your approach to product design. It's the cornerstone of consistent customer experiences.
  </p>
  </br>
  <img src="images/real deal estate/design language.png" alt="figma screenshot of design language">
  <br />
  <h3>design tokens</h3>
  <p>Variables that store values for the base layer of your design system, like colour and typography. They're used in components, so changes on this level will resonant throughout the whole system.</p>
  <br />
  <img src="images/real deal estate/design tokens.png" alt="figma screenshot of design tokens">
  <br />
  <h3>core components</h3>
  <p>Components are the main building blocks for user interfaces. Building a reusable component library enhances your product development workflow by reducing design and tech debt and speeding up the process. Core component can't be broken down into granular pieces without losing their meaning.</p>
  <br />
  <img src="images/real deal estate/core components.png" alt="figma screenshot of design tokens">
  <br />
  <h3>be like water, not like waterfall</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    We took an agile approach to this project, working in two week sprints in the following format.
  </p>
  <li>requirements interview with our ux researcher, senior developer, the client, and me</li>
  <li>iterate through our sprint feature design</li>
  <li>design review with developers</li>
  <li>implementation</li>
  <li>testing</li>
  <li>client review</li>
  <li>sprint retospective</li>
  <li>sprint planning and prioritization of next task</li>
  <br />
  <h3>priority list</h3>
  <hr />
  <p>
    I stopped by the office of our senior developer one day to talk about the design system. What was a quick design review, turned into a confession that the Design System was actually really overwhelming. I was surprised when I heard that, not because I didn't think it was but because I wasn't empathetic to the developers who were doing their best under a high pressure project. They were trying to do their best work and I didn't think of how I could support that. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We brainstormed a little, fixated on the overwhelming feeling of developing the functionality and styling the application to the expectations of the client. In order to combat this, we created a priority list of changes for the developers to focus on when it comes to styling. These were ordered based on their ease of implementation and the impact they have to the overall look and feel of the application.
  </p>
